# Platformer

This is a game I'm working on now that I have a little bit more Unity experience from my Strategy game!

The goal is for me to create a very simple platformer, inspired by games like Super Meat Boy and Celeste. I intend only for this to be a learning experience for me, as it's a lot different from the previous game I made - This one actually makes use of physics!

One of the goals I had when I started this project was to fully create the physics myself and not use any of Unity's built in physics systems. Although it's really hard, so far I've been able to successfully replicate the physics that many platformer games use, all using my own unique code! 

#Intended features:
- Simple platformer physics, including a gravity system and collision detection - ***Completed!***
- Intuitive and smooth player controls
- PS4 controller support
- Simple grid based UI system to support easy level design
- Level screen progression, and goalposts to finish levels

#Optional features (if time permits):
- Enemies with simple tracking AI
- Menu screen and level select with unlockable levels
